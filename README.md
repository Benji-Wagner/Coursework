# Coursework
This repo contains coding assignments from courses. Note that my work is carried out in Jupyter Notebooks, so to view my code in an easily-digestable manner, you will need to download the notebooks and view them in Jupyter.

## Intro To Python
This directory holds assignment work for BIOSTAT 821: Software Tools for Data Science. 
This course covers the basics of Python programming.

## Biomedical Big Data
This directory holds assignment work for BIOSTAT 823: Biomedical Big Data.
This course covers a wide range of Data Science applications, such as Natural Language Processing, Function Optimization, Database Queries, Clustering Techniques, and Supervised Machine Learning.

## Biomedical Case Studies
This course consisted of 3 Modules:
1. Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
2. High-Throughput Sequencing Data
3. Working with Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs)

The Google Colab notebook I used for Image Classification is located in this directory. 
For the sequencing data, I created a package with roxygen2 that demonstrates how reads can be mapped
to reference barcodes using a probabilistic error model. This is in its own repository, SequenceMapper.
The EHR project uses confidential patient information, so I uploaded the notebook without showing what the data looks like.
Feel free to contact me if you are curious to hear more about any of these 3 modules and/or their respective projects.
